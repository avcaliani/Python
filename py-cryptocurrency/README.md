App to learn about working with HTTP requests and JSON. In this project I'm using [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

## Quick Start

> ðŸ‘‰ Before run this script make sure that you are using a Python 3 virtual environment ;)

```sh
# Start App
python main.py

# Get some coins (Default is 100 Coins)
$ get coins

# Get $NUMBER coins, 0 to bring all.
$ get coins -n $NUMBER

# Show All Coins
$ show coins

# Show Coin that is represented by $SYMBOL
$ show coins -s "$SYMBOL"
```
